# Gaur Vaults

A platform to stake your assets and watch them grow.

## What is a Gaur Vault?

Based off of famous vaults in our past (Beefy, Yern, Pickle) we have taken all of th ebest ones and have utalized them on our platform. In most cases even upgrading them to the new Vault token standard.

By using a vault, you can still retain control over your assets but get the conveniance and power of automated stratgies. When you deposit your tokens you will get a recipt token that is representative of your share of the vault. 
As the strategies gain more assets the ratio changes making it so that you will be withdrawing more then what you pu in. With the new ERC-4626 standard of Intrest Bearing tokens, this takes that to a whole new kind of level. 
Now that all fo the vault tokens are on the same page we can create lending and borrowoing positions that will pay themselves off because the interest gaining from the strategy will ultimatly pay off your loan at dome point. This is just the begining when 
it comes to vaults and we will be on the fore front of the action bringing you the best possible yields and stratigies around.

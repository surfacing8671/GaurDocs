# Getting Started with Gaur Vaults



## Overview

Gaur Vaults are a what you would call a yield optamizer. Simply put it optamizes the yields on your assets in a variety of ways. Those are called strategies and you can find out more information on each one in the [strategies](stratlink) section. 

## Quickstart

1. Find a vault that uses the token that you want the most.
2. Make sure that you have that asset in your wallet.
3. Stake your tokens in the vault. 
4. Sit back, relax, and check in on your gains. The longer you have your assets inside of the vault, the more rapidly they will grow over time. This is because the rewards gained are reinvested back into the vault compounding your rewards. 

5. Whenever you are ready or want to use those tokens, simply withdraw them from the vault!

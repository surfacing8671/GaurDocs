A Vault is simple, you lend it your asets and it will put it to work for you. Some of th emost common ones are from Beefy Finance. Most of there vaults put your LP token to work in a farm and sell of the rewards
to make more of the deposited LP token compounding your rewards! The Gaur Vaults use several of Beefy contracts on our platfomr as well as several others to make find the best kind of strategies suitable for your needs. 

## Interest Bearing token

When you deposit funds into a vault, you will get a vault share token in return. This signafies your deposit into the vault an must be used to redeem your underlying tokens. The cool thing is tho, that because the vaults are always
gaining more tokens while your vault tokens stay the same meas that they are gaining in value always over time. Now this is a token amount and not necessarily USD value. Because the ratio changes in favor of the depositied token, we can call them interest bearing tokens. 
This now opens the doors of possabilities in the DeFi worl like self repaying debt. Lets say i take a loan out on some collateral, and that collateral was an interest bearing token. Over time my collaterall will pay off the loan all by its self. 
We are still in the very early days of this concept and im sure there are many more things to come.

## ERC-4626 Standard

Up untill recently, ther was no concensus on how these interest bearing tokens should interact with platforms and other daaps. Thus the ERC-4626 interface was board to standardize all of these tokens so that we are all on the same page. 
Just like the NFT was born form the ERC-721 token, the new age of interest bearing tokens are now born from the ERC-4626. This is huge and we have whole harfefly adopted this standard on almost all of our vaults.
